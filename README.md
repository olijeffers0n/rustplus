A lot of code and ideas have come from the JavaScript version of a wrapper, so I will credit it now:
[RustPlus.js](https://github.com/liamcottle/rustplus.js)
I have used his Protocol Buffer file for generating the necessary requests so chuck some support their way


## Installation:
Install the package with:
```
pip install rustplus
```
It should also install all the dependencies, but if not you will have to install them yourself

## What can you do?
- Get the Map
- Get Team Info
- Get Team Chat
- Get Server Info
- Send Team Messages
- Getting the time
- Using Smart Devices
- And so much more!

# For information on all the above methods, see the [Wiki](https://rplus.ollieee.xyz)

### Support:
If you need help, or you think that there is an issue feel free to open an issue. If you think you have made some improvements, open a PR! 

I have tried to explain this a well as possible, but if you should need further clarification, join me on my discord server:
